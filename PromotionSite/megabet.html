                                <p>If you're feeling lucky, put your luck to the test with Megabet. Win, and we'll double your cash; lose, and we'll take half of it.</p>

                                <p>Your mission is to draw a code. If the code you draw is a winner, unused, and has winning neighbors, get ready to celebrate your victory!</p>
                                
                                For example:
                                <p>Let's say you draw code number 45, and it's a winner and unused. If codes 44 and 46 around it match, your cash gets doubled. Otherwise, you'll part with half of your winnings.</p>
