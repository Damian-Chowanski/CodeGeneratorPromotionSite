                                <p>Time to test your luck! Hit the Spin button to see if you can draw three winning codes. Just be cautious not to wipe out your entire cash stash in the process.</p>

                                <p>If you manage to draw 3 winning codes, you'll pocket $100. However, for every unsuccessful attempt, $50 will be deducted from your funds.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Your codes come with special symbols:</p>
                                    
                                <p>Diamond: Indicates your code is a winner. Can you draw three of these beauties?</p>
                                <p>Empty box: Signifies your code has already been used.</p>
                                <p>Cracked diamond: Diamonds don't crack that easily. Tough luck this time!</p>
                                
                                <p>Feel free to keep playing as long as you've got cash or codes, because each spin costs you 3 codes from the previously generated list.</p>
