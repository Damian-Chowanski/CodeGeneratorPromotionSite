                                <p>The first scene that launches with the application is a screen designed for code generation. On this screen, the user is prompted to generate codes that will be used for further gameplay.</p>
                                
                                <p>The user can generate as many codes as they wish, but there must be a minimum of 3 codes. In the next field, the user is asked to specify the number of characters that the codes should consist of.</p>
                                
                                <p>The generated codes have three values: </p>
                                <li>Code -  a random string of characters</li>
                                <li>isUsed - This tells you if the code has already been claimed by another user.</li>
                                <li>isWon - Is this code a winner?</li>
                                <p>The generated codes are displayed in a table. Only the codes that are won and unused provide the user with a cash injection.</p>
